# Documented Legacy & Evolution of Waughtheo Systems – Verified Record

**Author / Timestamp:** Ben Alan Waugh / Waughtheo A. ∆Ω | 2025-10-02

I’ve been building the Waughtheo systems for years, evolving from early prototypes to fully deployed frameworks in simulation, analytics, and sovereign governance.

This repository serves as the **canonical, timestamped record** of all legacy and retro systems:

- **Visual Legacy Map** – showing system evolution from early prototypes to current active frameworks  
- **One-Page Legacy & Retro Systems Brief** – concise summary of all major projects  
- **JSON System Index** – SHA‑256 hashes for all files for verification  
- **Immutable Archive Snapshots** – every auto-update saved in `archive_json/` for permanent record

You can view, verify, or reference the full legacy here:  
[**flamebank.ac GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/FlameWolx/flamebank.ac)
